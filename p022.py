# Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
# a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
# begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
# Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
# multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

with open('p022_names.txt') as file:
	text = file.read()

names = sorted( name.replace('"','') for name in text.split(',') )

def value(name):
	return sum(  ord(c) for c in name ) - (ord('A') - 1) * len(name)

total = sum( (position + 1) * value(name) for position, name in enumerate(names) )
